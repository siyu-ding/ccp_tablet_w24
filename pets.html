                <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to
                    the
                    Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
                    personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the
                    window to
                    keep watch of his house. Do not let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
                    mailman and squirrels every single day.
                    Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Plutoâ€™s favorite part of the
                    day is
                    his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his
                    toy
                    duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some
                    practice with his toy duck.

                <p>Maple is a 2 year old tabby cat with brown stripes. She is very playful and friendly but also loves
                    lounging in the sun! Maple is a huge fan of treats - she has even learned how to open doors to steal
                    some extra treats.
                    Sometimes Maple has boundless energy. At night, she gets the zoomies after eating her final meal of
                    the
                    day. It usually takes her another hour to settle down before she can take a long nap.
